## Introduction

Hong Kong Jockey Club offers parimutuel betting on horse racing, along with the largest horse racing pool in the world. In Hong Kong, betting on horse racing is ingrained in local culture and is seen as an investment.

Horse betting required significant knowledge in biology, psychology, game theory or even mathematics. In order to share my experience and approach, I will try to make everyting as simple as possible.

## Basic Concept

Compared to the casino game such as craps, the gambler has the negative expected return. One of hte simple example is the coin flip betting.

Imagine the following coin flip scenario with probability of land on head and tail is 0.6 and 0.4 respectively:
```math
P(Head) = 0.6,
P(Tail) = 0.4
```
The payoff of both head and tail is 2 to 1. Under this circumstance, the expected value (EV) of betting on head can be calculated as below:
```math
EV = P(Head) \times Payoffs = 0.6 \times 2 = 1.2
```
1.2 EV (greater than 1) is a positive expected value. It means you will get 20% profit on average when betting on head. Similar to the horse racing, the basic strategy is keep picking the horse with positive expected result iteratively.

## Personal Experience in HKJC

I have over 6 years racetrack betting experience in HKJC, while a approximately 1.2 millions HKD betting amount has been accumulated in 1,100 races. There are details records keep tracking race by race, here is some sharings and conslusions.

To illustrate the difficulties in race betting, I have picked profit and loss records among 2 separate race seasons as example.
