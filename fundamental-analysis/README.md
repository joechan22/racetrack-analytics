# Fundamental Analytics

Similar to the stocks investment, analyzing the fundamental factors can also be applied to the horse racing. Some basic fundamental factors are listed as below.

- wieght to be carried
- age of the horse
- recent performance of the jockey
- recent performance of the trainer
- performance of the horse in last races
- finish position in last races

The comprehensive fundamental racing model required professional domain knowledge and experience, besides, it involves a lots of data to be consolidated and analyzed by sophisticated statistic model such as neural network for digging out the non-linear relationship between the factors and final result.

Moreover, it is almost impossible to collect all factos affecting the final race race since the luck is difficult to weight.
